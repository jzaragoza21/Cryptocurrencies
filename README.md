## Overview of Project

The objective of this challenge is to do an analysis and report on cryptocurrencies for a prominent investment bank utilizing unsupervised machine learning techniques. The deliverables are as follows:

 - Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
 - Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA Deliverable 
 - Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means Deliverable 
 - Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

This report ultimately includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for investing in this new market.
